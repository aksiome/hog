# Heads of Gluttony

Heads of Gluttony is a Minecraft datapack that lets you craft powerful, wearable heads that gain unique abilities when you devour the right items.  
Each head has its own purpose and can be upgraded as you consume specially crafted materials.

### Upgrading

To upgrade your head, you must craft and eat Heavy Blocks.
These must be consumed in the correct order, as each tier increases your head‚Äôs level.
Each new level unlocks an additional effect slot, allowing you to store more active powers.

#### Heavy Block of Iron (Level 1)

### Activating Effects

To activate effects, you‚Äôll need Infused Heavy Cores.
Use a Smithing Table to combine a Heavy Core with a specific material to infuse it.

- Each infused core grants a unique effect when eaten.
- Some effects can stack up to level II.
- The Heavy Core is returned after eating an Infused Core (but not when upgrading the head).
